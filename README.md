# Making of this website

Not strictly in this order, but more or less...

## Planning

- Decide which breakpoints to support (e.g. mobile + desktop sizes)
- Plan the layout visually (paper or whiteboard)
- Plan the behavior / UX / user flow / user journey (e.g. when I click this link, I should be taken to a site where I can book flights)

## Preparing

- Create / source / prepare the content (text and images, including resizing)
- Initialize a git repo

## Coding

- Set up the HTML structure
- Include Normalize CSS
- Create custom CSS file
- Styled the layout (boxes)
- Start the global typography (body text)
- Refine visual details
